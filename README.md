# SteamLinkAudioDrivers
The Steam Link audio drivers for Windows 8.1 and 10 PCs, hosted here since I couldn't find an official Valve download for them.

If you're unaware, Steam Link is a feature that allows the real-time playing of your Steam Library to and from various platforms. The audio drivers are typically installed on the first stream and any subsequent streams. One thing that seems to have gone relatively unnoticed about them is that at their core, the Steam Streaming Microphone and Steam Streaming Speakers are both functionally drop-in replacements for any existing Virtual Audio Cable setup, and it's FREE! This is the backbone of my Soundboard.
